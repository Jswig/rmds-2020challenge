## Initial approach

- split datasets between each person

## Tech stack

- pandas/geopandas
- matplotlib/basemap

notebooks naming scheme: `name-purpose-01.ipynb`

## Datesets

Interesting datasets and person assigned to explore the dataset:
- Recreation and parks: Shravani
- Grocery stores: Shravani
- Traffic in LA: Anders
- social vulnerability score: Shravani
- COVID-19 Latitude / Longitude: Anders
- Google Places API Traffic: Julian
- safegraph foot traffic: Anders
- Covid-19 by neighborhood: Everyone (cross-compare with data you have)

## Evaluating Risk score

- Framingham risk score
- Actuarial risk scores 
- Bayesian decision theoy

Definition of risk: 
score should be higher if place is "associated" with testing positive. 

## Idea 
Calculate the risk score by neighborhood (and get more neighborhood)
Scope: city of LA
